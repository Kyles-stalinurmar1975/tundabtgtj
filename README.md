Wow, just stumblin' outta the cinema — Rosario, wow, I mean... where do I even start? You know, when you’re in the middle of it and there's that little old lady in the front row with this laugh like a broken microwave and it’s all part of it and somehow makes the movie even more... like part of the plot. Ugh, I got popcorn in my shoe — how the hell does that even happen, right?

Oh man, the scene with the cat... or was it a dog? Some animal and that weird music like a kazoo being strangled, or was it a tuba? Anyway, that part was insane. Totally felt like my first haircut — you know, where you can't really see what's happening and you just hope for the best. And the colors! They just swirled like when you mix all the hair dye together and you expect a rainbow but get brown sludge instead. Beautiful, messy.

> Rosario's face lit up the screen but the plot... like a foggy morning after too much wine, dude. You could almost feel the humidity in there, sticking to the back of your neck like a wool scarf you can't take off. My back is still sore from leaning in all tensed up, waiting to grab onto something, anything, from the story. And the chair was squeaky, so every time I shifted, I was practically soundtracking my own personal horror movie down there.

Download the movie, people keep saying that. But you gotta watch the movie in a theater, seriously, with all the noises and whispers and that interminable crunching sound. Takes you places, like, outside your regular haircut drama universe.

Characters — so blurry, like someone took their face and smudged it across the screen with a greasy thumb, yet compelling? You know? Like they meant to mean something. I think it's about fate or carpets, something deep, or maybe just tangled hair.
